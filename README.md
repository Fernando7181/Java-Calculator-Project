# Java-Calculator-Project
Its and Project to create a back end java calculator 
Well, This Project Started when  i said to my friends that i wanted to creat a calculator in Java, I started creating a The folder numbers so it could save all of it 
add, sub, mult, div. and it would bring the X and Y from tha main storaging it. using and putting fist x and y = 0  the programm will ask you what kind of thing you want to do. based on that they will ask the first number as X and the second as Y going to the numbers function. for you to chose the method was used a switch case and a HashMap so it so could show it at the end of the program.
