# Java-Calculator-Project
It and Project to create a back end java calculator 
Well, This Project Started when  I told my friends that I wanted to create a calculator in Java, I started creating folder numbers so it could save all of it 
add, sub, mult, div. and it would bring the X and Y from the main storing it. using and putting fist x and y = 0  the program will ask you what kind of thing you want to do. based on that they will ask for the first number as X and the second as Y going to the numbers function. You can choose the method, a switch case, and a HashMap so it can show at the end of the program.
